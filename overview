**The U.S. is the world's leading producer of innovation, and university ecosystems are a key contributor.**

 \
Investing in fundamental innovative work helps us to solve life’s most essential problems and better prepares us for the future. However, global research and development (R&D) performance is concentrated in a few countries, with the United States performing the most—$656 billion, or 27% of global R&D in 2019, the most recent year available.<sup>1</sup>

Publication of research in peer-reviewed literature is a primary mechanism for disseminating new knowledge, enabling the use of discoveries for further innovation. U.S. publications are highly impactful, as measured by citations. From 2000 to 2018, the United States contributed nearly twice as many highly cited articles as would be expected given the overall publication output of the United States.<sup>2</sup>

The US federal government is the single largest funder of basic research (41%). The federal government also funds the greatest proportion of any form of R&D performed by higher education institutions (50%). 

U.S. universities perform the largest proportion of basic research (46%); they are also the most prolific producers of utility patents, [holding nine of the 10 top academic positions](https://academyofinventors.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/NAI-IPO-Top-100-Universities-Granted-U.S.-Utility-Patents-2020.pdf) globally. These universities frequently leverage this intellectual property by licensing innovations to outside entities, often to newly established startup companies spun off from university research activity. This form of commercialization is on the rise, with new university-associated startups increasing from 388 in 2000 to 1,029 in 2019.

**The innovation funding landscape in transition.**

However, funding for basic research has been on the decline over the past decade. Although federal funding of R&D increased from $127 billion in 2010 to an estimated $139 billion in 2019, the share of total R&D funded by the federal government declined from 31% in 2010 to an estimated 21% in 2019. This decline occurred across all research types and sectors.

Correspondingly, federal government support for full-time science & engineering (S&E) graduate students was down to 15% in 2019 (from 19% in 2010).<sup>3</sup>

Because higher education institutions perform the largest proportion of basic research (with graduate students providing a large amount of the intellectual horsepower necessary to do actual bench research, edit findings and refine data, and publish), declining shares of federal support for higher education could limit the ability of the United States both to perform R&D and to maintain its intellectual competitive advantage.

**University research labs optimize for the wrong things.**

[Over the past half-century](https://autm.net/about-tech-transfer/advocacy/legislation/bayh-dole-act), “intellectual property commercialization” and “technology incubation” have become well understood concepts at American universities, with schools creating increasingly sophisticated efforts to bring valuable innovation to market.

However, as government support has decreased, subsidization by corporate interests has narrowed the research aperture. 

Basic research—the backbone of all academic commercialization efforts—has [had its definition repurposed](https://ssti.org/blog/changing-nature-us-basic-research-trends-federal-spending); the decline in government support, and [corresponding increase in corporate subsidization](https://ssti.org/blog/changing-nature-us-basic-research-trends-funding-sources), has subsequently [limited the creative horizons of those associated.](https://www.pnas.org/content/117/22/12011)

The result is that many of academia’s brightest work on projects primarily at the behest of corporate benefactors in very narrow areas of concern. 

The net impact of the best minds working for corporations as outsourced R&D labs—beyond an overall reduction in development of emerging ideas—is that the rest are left to fight over scraps: most academics (i.e., not those privileged few endowed with the pedigree and credentials to attract corporate support and/or outside private funding) are [spending over 50% of their time writing grant applications](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/1/18/18183939/science-funding-grant-lotteries-research)—time that could be better spent doing more productive activities, like actual research. 

**A crisis of talent and credibility.**

This model—of declining federal funding paired with increasingly competitive application / publication processes—is increasingly less attractive to many, especially when well-paying jobs can readily be found in the private sector.

For those individuals who do choose to continue focusing their careers on productive research, the other option is to leave academia in order to commercialize their developments, raising money through success in an open market. If they have the requisite credibility, live in the correct geographic regions, and know the right groups of people, they _may_ be able to attract funding from traditional sources of private capital (e.g., venture capital or angel funding). However, the individuals who have this credibility have likely already have experienced success while in academia, and are therefore likely to benefit (commercially or otherwise) from the narrowing aperture of university research. 

The result for those not so fortunate is a “catch-22”, where young researchers are either stuck in academia trying to gather credibility via the “publication treadmill”—the intended outcome being a tenured professorship within the university system—or an exit from the entire university research ecosystem due to a lack of credibility upon which they can fundraise.

The unfortunate result often is a “brain drain” of promising young talent, creating a skills and capability gap that inevitably grows wider with time.

**How do we stop this?**

Losing enthusiastic, creative researchers due to the inequities of the current system does not have to be a foregone conclusion. Recent technological developments provide the tools for creating a solution.

[Web3](https://future.a16z.com/why-web3-matters/), a conceptual redefinition of the internet incorporating concepts including decentralization, open governance, and interoperability, may hold the key to providing young researchers a path towards academic credibility that does not involve unending publication edits and [exploitation](https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2018/may/18/academia-exploitation-university-mental-health-professors-plagiarism).

Blockchain technologies have been around for over a decade now; their applications are increasingly less about creating “coins” as a form of wager in a virtual casino, and more about designing distributed democratic systems. No one has control of these decentralized networks; they are owned and operated by their users. “Blockchains are special computers that nobody owns,” A16Z General Partner Chris Dixon says. And these “computers” can be used to create unique value systems online, in the form of tokens. 

Tokens provide property rights on the internet; much like how Property Law affords owners of physical real estate special rights of access and exclusion in the United States, tokens (built and distributed on the blockchain) provide holders special rights that they and other holders outline and agree to. 

Tokens can be imbued with any form of value the users wish; they are a proxy for the concerns of whoever holds them. They can be used like currency (see: [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/en/)), but they can also be used to signify interest, or bestow credibility. Additionally, different parameters can be applied to tokens in order to identify nominal value and encourage utilization—they can be made finite (as in, only so many will ever be created and distributed); they can be given away for free with a predefined value already set; they can be created with “expiration dates” built in (where trading ends at a certain point in time); or they can exist on a [dynamic curve](https://defiprime.com/unisocks-explained), where every additional token has a different par value from the one prior. The point is that tokens are a tool that provides the maximum flexibility of ownership rights to its holder, and can be constructed with incentives encouraging a robust transactional environment . 

Pairing cryptographic tokens with recent developments and trends (such as the [modernization of the regulatory environment](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2020-191), the [consumerization of finance](https://theconversation.com/wallstreetbets-is-disrupting-financial-markets-possibly-permanently-154355), the increasingly distributed nature of capital as individuals [move away from traditional investment hubs](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/14/silicon-valleys-share-of-venture-capital-may-drop-below-20percent-in-2021.html), as well as the [continued growth of sports betting](https://fortune.com/2022/01/24/legalized-sports-betting-in-the-u-s-doubled-in-2021-heres-why-that-will-continue-after-the-greatest-weekend-in-nfl-playoff-history/)), AlumDAO is developing a model to provide academics an alternative path to credibility not reliant on making them traverse the publishing treadmill, or answerable to a corporate benefactor.

**The AlumDAO Community **

[Alumshares](https://alumshares.com/) is a platform where alumni can invest in technologies developed at their alma mater, and where emerging innovation can find a cohort interested in its success. 

In our efforts to identify the most promising opportunities, we realized that academia is suffering from the recognition crisis outlined. In an era when high-paying jobs can readily be found in the private sector, now more than ever we need to rethink how we recognize graduate students for their efforts, and look to build a system of credible incentives. 

That's where AlumDAO comes in. After working for many years in the academic commercialization space, we’ve experienced firsthand that there are great ideas out there being stifled by the existing model. Our aim is to create a new model to allow promising research to flourish and find a path to the market.  \


AlumDAO brings current and former academic researchers, funding, and promising early-stage research together to build a community that creates credibility through continued interaction, analysis, and growth. It seeks to utilize a highly distributed, democratic, liquid and transferable blockchain-based voting structure to enable alumni to ensure meritorious innovations—and their innovators—get the attention deserved.

**What is a DAO?**

[DAO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_autonomous_organization): A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), sometimes called a decentralized autonomous corporation (DAC), is an organization represented by rules encoded as a computer program that is transparent, controlled by the organization members and not influenced by a central government. A DAO's financial transaction record and program rules are maintained on a blockchain.

The AlumDAO is focused on enabling those interested alumni with special expertise to help recognize and support those innovations most likely to have commercial viability. 

**$ALUM Token / IP NFTs / Commercialization Plan**

By utilizing tokenization, blockchain, and the collective wisdom of a fully distributed organization of knowledgeable alumni, we seek to bring promising research to light, and provide mechanisms for facilitating consequent commercialization activities

Here’s how it works: \




* The AlumDAO provides or sells participants access tokens, $ALUM, which can be used to vote for interesting, meritorious innovations as well vote in the operations of the DAO itself.
* $ALUM holders, go wild: all ideas and opportunities are sourced and reviewed by the DAO’s expert network of university alumni—the opportunities are only as good as those you yourself put forward
* Once an opportunity is identified, it enters the AlumDAO “Inference Market” — how do you feel about this opportunity?
    * $ALUM can be used to vote “to proceed” or “not to proceed”
        * Note: $ALUM is a token providing access to the AlumDAO Inference Market; only token holders can vote
        * Note: each $ALUM token represents a single vote; users can hold more than one $ALUM, therefore controlling more than one vote; a user can technically hold an infinite number of $ALUM tokens, although there are a finite number of immutable $ALUM tokens
* If the AlumDAO community votes to proceed, it may seek to pursue a transaction to acquire rights to the IP in question
* If a commercial entity is created around the IP in question, or a separate commercial transaction is entered into with a third party (such as Alumshares, AngelList, etc) for the rights to said IP, an $ALUM token-supported NFT can be converted into a registered security with an ownership stake in the entity in question
* Note: The $ALUM tokens intentionally have a finite life of 5 years to ensure the DAO remains decentralized to allow new and fresh ideas. If the $ALUM had infinite life, the DAO would naturally become more centralized over time and ownership and decision making would accrue disproportionally to the early members. \


**This is NOT a security**

$ALUM tokens are NOT intended to represent an investment security; they are merely intended to provide holders access to the AlumDAO Inference Market, affording the holder a discrete voting right (per $ALUM). Please note that there should be no expectation of a future profit from $ALUM tokens; you should expect $ALUM to be worthless on its own. The group community will operate in a fully decentralized and not based on the entrepreneurial and managerial efforts of others. $ALUM functions principally as a digital currency which can be converted into other digital currencies or assets. 

**Additional Detail**

There will be versions of $ALUM tokens; they will expire at the end of a pre-designated period of time. The intent is to encourage collaboration and trading (rather than hoarding).

The first version of $ALUM tokens (V.01) will have 10,000,000 (10 million) tokens, with an initial price of $10 USD. 

Certain activities unlock tokens. Signing up to be a member of AlumDAO will automatically unlock 5 $ALUM; submitting research for review by other DAO members will unlock 15 $ALUM. An approved and accepted research topic—voted on and accepted by $ALUM token holders—will unlock additional distribution of $ALUM for the successful research, the quantity depending on level of support. Separately, additional tokens can be unlocked by working in various organizations within the DAO, including but not limited to research review-oriented working groups.

When an individual joins AlumDAO and submits a piece of work for review, it goes into a working group for peer review; the intent is to determine not the efficacy of the discrete research, but the scientific merit of the document itself (i.e., does it pass the “sniff test”—a relatively low bar). The review portion of the process is operated by the research working group, and is therefore not subject to token holder review.

Once a research topic has been reviewed and approved by the research working group for consideration by the broader $ALUM community, it moves into the proposal phase. The proposal phase is where token holders have the opportunity to vote on scientific merit—specifically, likelihood of commercialization (market need and, where appropriate, replicability necessarily being implicated).

In the proposal phase, the research author explains the research, its value/benefits, as well as any other aspects / credentials likely to be valuable to a voting token holder (e.g., researchers background, university associations, private partnerships, etc.)

Again, $ALUM is freely transferable. It grants holders access to vote in the DAO. 

The window for utilizing tokens votes on research and the operations of the DAO is finite; once closed, no other voting will be available on a specific opportunity. Note also that since tokens have an expiration, certain tokens will only be able to be utilized for certain voting opportunities. Again, the intent is to foster engagement, not to incentivize hoarding behaviors.

During the proposal phase, $ALUM holders define the level of support for a specific research opportunity. Token holders can vote numerous times, based on the number of tokens they hold. If enough support is reached, the $ALUM will be exchanged for a “IP NFT” and the researcher will be “Published” and receive $ALUM. 

IP NFTs will be ranked according to the number of $ALUM tokens voted; they will be distributed—from highest ranked to lowest—according to the number of tokens allocated for voting per research opportunity.  

Once research is published and NFTs are allocated, NFT holders will hold an asset with a powerful convertible ability. Specifically, a Right of First Refusal and substantial discount from IP NFT to invest in SPV that may or may not follow if this research is used as the basis to form a startup to commercialize it in the future.

_The AlumDAO tokens, $ALUM, are digital membership tokens and we have yet to do an analysis on the tax deductibility of them. (AlumDAO is anticipated to be a non-profit organization)._
